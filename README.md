#### The Ice Wizard

‚ùÑ He can shoot iceballs and freeze things (and enemies)! But he is old and moves slowly.

Each player can control one character at a time, and can switch between the ones
that are not taken. All characters must be used to complete the puzzles and find
the treasure!

# Building and running

This project uses `yarn` as its dependency manager, so first run

```
yarn
```

to download dependencies.

The run

```
yarn build-dev
```

to build the development server (the production server wasn't implemented)

and then

```
yarn start
```

to start the server.

After that, you and others on the same network can go to `http://<your-local-ip>:8000` to join the game (press spacebar once the first screen shows up)

# Issues

This game was created for a subject and learning purposes, so it's far from
complete, many things don't work as intended, but we hope it can still help
anyone working with Phaser 3 out there.
